# Welcome To My React Portfolio Repository!

# Specifically this Repo is for the Backend of the app

The repo is home to the backend code for my portfolio, ready for production. The repo contains only the backend code. The repository on my github called Portfolio-React holds both the front end and back end code. If you are wanting to clone this and run it locally you can head on over there to download that code.

This project includes the following;

- OpenAI API
- Connection to emails via the contact form

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to start the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `node server.js`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
The frontend of the app will need to be run at the same time, to do this head over to my front end repo and follow the instructions there!
